**4) Social network!** _[40% total]_

Assume a world in which no two people have the same name.
Create an object `people` whose purpose is to remember everyone ever mentioned and the relationships between them.

**a)** _[Moderate, 25%]_

Write three methods for `people`:

* `people.meet(nameA,nameB)` should accept two names, update `people`, and return the total number of times those two have met, including this new meeting.
If either person isn't yet represented in `people`, add them.
Then increment a count of the meetings between them.
Assume that the order of arguments doesn't matter (i.e. `meet(A,B)` is the same as `meet(B,A)`), and that meeting oneself _(A==B)_ has no effect.

* `people.haveMet(nameA,nameB)` should return a number greater than 0 if those people have met, and some falseish value if they haven't or don't exist.

* `people.friendsOf(name)` should return a string listing the names of all people whom `name` has met at least once (or undefined if `name` doesn't exist).   List the names in alphabetical order, and make sure each name appears only once.

You may use the enclosed [template file](social-network-template.js) to get started.

_Hint:_ the `people` object should contain an index of all people, linking each name to an individual object for that person.  Each such person-object should have two properties:

* `name` is a string for that person's name.  (This redundant copy of the name isn't necessary for the solution, but it may help you debug.)

* `friends` is another index object, unique to each person, with multiple keys (one for each friend that person has met), each with a numeric value.  Because meetings are symmetric (each person meets the other), each number is duplicated in a corresponding property in the friend's index; make sure you update both copies of the number during a meeting.

Here is a diagram showing the data structure after `people` is fully initialized but before any method calls:

Here is the data structure just after the first method call `people.meet('Matt','Tom')`:

**b)** _[Difficult, 15%]_

Write another method `people.friendsOfFriendsOf(name)` which returns a string listing, in alphabetical order, all the names of people within two degrees of separation from `name`: they've met either `name` or at least one of `name`'s friends.
Your list may include `name` itself but no duplicates: any person should be listed only once regardless of the number of connections with `name`.

(_Hint:_ the union of sets includes no duplicates!  Perhaps you could recycle code from somewhere?)
